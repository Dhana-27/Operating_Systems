# Operating-system-
# OS Code Examples

This repository contains a collection of system programming examples related to operating system concepts, including FIFO CPU scheduling, shell scripts for tasks like odd/even number checks, and other utilities implemented in Bash, C, and Vim scripts. The project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate OS algorithms and scripting techniques.

## Features
- *FIFO CPU Scheduling*: A C program implementing First-In-First-Out process scheduling.
- *Odd/Even Shell Script*: A Bash script to check if a number is odd or even.
- *Vim Utilities*: Example Vim scripts for automation or text processing.
- *Other Utilities*: Additional scripts for OS-related tasks (e.g., process management, file operations).

## Requirements
- *Operating System*: Linux (Ubuntu recommended), macOS, or WSL on Windows.
- *Software*:
  - GCC compiler (gcc) for C programs.
  - Bash (bash) for shell scripts.
  - Vim (vim) for Vim scripts.
  - Optional: make for building C programs.
- *Hardware*: Any system capable of running a terminal and compiling C code.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/os-code-examples.git
